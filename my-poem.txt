This is a haiku
I was a musician now
Becoming a dev

I guess being a
Musician will help me write

Bing bada bing ba boom
Boop de woop de pop de wop
Chinga chinga bing bong

Meep morp beep borp
I am a robot

Enter the code
Meep morp
And I will execute your wishes
Beep borp
Buzz buzz
Meep morp
Robot time
